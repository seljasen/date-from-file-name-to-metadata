# date-from-file-name-to-metadata
This python scripts aims at setting the creation date of scanned photo to the actual date of the picture.

The basis of this project is to set correct creation time on digitized films and photos. 
For photos I assume that you save each folder into a digital folder with filenames following step 1 in this convension:

Image files will not be altered or considered. The date given will be taken from its mother folder name. 

For movies, the actual date or year, month will need to be included in the filenames. 
Otherwise the same convension as for pictures is used. 

Start filenames for movies, or folder names for pictures with YYYY-MM-DD and use XX when in doubt.
